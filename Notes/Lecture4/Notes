Good interview question: implement memory allocator
- need to provide API similar to malloc(size_t size) and free( void* ptr)
- Where do we get the memory: _aligned_malloc()

misallocation for strings: (forgetting null terminator)
stale pointers: allocate memory, free memory, someone trys to use the pointer. (very hard to track down). can build system to track for it.
Need to track allocator

malloc(32)

Proper singly linked list: two lists behind, a free list and a in use list
